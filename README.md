Basic Idea
----------

A shebang-friendly script for "interpreting" single C99, C11, and C++ files,
including rcfile support.  [![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/RhysU/c99sh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RhysU/c99sh)

For example, installing this `~/.c99shrc` control file

    -Wall -g -O2
    #include <stdio.h>

permits executing [hello](basic/hello) containing

    #!/usr/bin/env c99sh
    int main()
    {
        puts("Hello, world!");
    }

to produce the output one expects provided [c99sh](c99sh) is in the path. You
may also run `c99sh foo.c` to execute some `foo.c` lacking the shebang line. Try
`c99sh -v foo.c` if you encounter trouble and want to see the compilation
command. Check out `c99sh -h` for all the command line options you might use. In
particular, for simple tasks you might find that the command line options in
conjunction with HERE documents can accomplish many things.  For example,

    $ ./c99sh -sm <<HERE
    puts("Hello, world!");
    HERE

One Line Statements
-------------------

To run a one line statement, append a 1 (one) to the arg list along with m and
use like:

c99sh -ms1 'printf("hi, there\n");'

Note that single quotes around the statement makes echo command to use the
string in it as is, which helps.

Control Files
-------------

Control files can supply compilation and linking flags, preprocessor directives
like `#include`, and
[pkg-config](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) directives to
simplify library usage. A `c99shrc` located in the same directory as the
interpreted source will be used. Otherwise a `~/.c99shrc` is processed if
available. See [c99shrc.example](c99shrc.example) for an extended control file
enabling [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/),
[GLib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/), and [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/)
capabilities.  This permits quickly getting access to higher-level data
structures.

A more entertaining example is an [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/)-enabled Monte
Carlo computation of Ï€ screaming like a banshee on all your cores
([c99shrc](openmp/c99shrc), [source](openmp/pi)):

    #!/usr/bin/env c99sh

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        long long niter = argc > 1 ? atof(argv[1]) : 100000;
        long long count = 0;

        #pragma omp parallel
        {
            unsigned int seed = omp_get_thread_num();

            #pragma omp for reduction(+: count) schedule(static)
            for (long long i = 0; i < niter; ++i) {
                const double x = rand_r(&seed) / (double) RAND_MAX;
                const double y = rand_r(&seed) / (double) RAND_MAX;
                count += sqrt(x*x + y*y) < 1;
            }

        }

        printf("%lld: %g\n", niter, M_PI - 4*(count / (double) niter));
    }

Take that, [GIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock).

Kidding aside, the speedup in the edit-compile-run loop can be handy during
prototyping or analysis.  It is nice when useful one-off scripts can be moved
directly into C ABI code instead of requiring an additional
{Python,Octave,R}-to-C translation and debugging phase.  For example, compare
the [Octave version](gsl/nozzle_match.m) of some simple logic with the
[equivalent c99sh-based version](gsl/nozzle_match) requiring only a few
[one-time additions](gsl/c99shrc) to your `~/.c99shrc`.

Shebang Tricks
--------------

Dual shebang/compiled support, that is a source file that can be both
interpreted via `./shebang.c` and compiled via `gcc shebang.c`, can most
succinctly be achieved as follows:

    #if 0
    exec c99sh "$0"
    #endif

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {
        printf("Hello, world!\n");
    }

This dual shebang approach permits quick testing/iteration on valid
C source files using the `-t` option:

    #if 0
    exec c99sh -t 'test()' "$0"
    #endif

    #include <stdio.h>

    int logic()
    {
        return 42;
    }

    static void test()
    {
        printf("%d\n", logic());
    }

Testing in this manner resembles how folks use Python's `__main__` inside
libraries.

C++
---

As nearly the entire C99-oriented implementation works for C++, by invoking
[c99sh](c99sh) through either a copy or symlink named [cxxsh](cxxsh), you can
write C++-based logic.  The relevant control files are named like `cxxshrc` in
this case and they support directives like `using namespace std` and `namespace
fb = foo::bar`.  See [cxx/hello](cxx/hello) and [cxx/cxxshrc](cxx/cxxshrc) for a
hello world C++ example.  See [cxx/shebang.cpp](cxx/shebang.cpp) and
[cxx/quicktest.cpp](cxx/quicktest.cpp) for C++ dual shebang/compiled idioms.

One nice use case is hacking atop [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) since it
provides pkg-config support. That is, `cxxsh -p eigen3 myprogram` builds and
runs a one-off, Eigen-based program.  With the right `cxxshrc`, such a program
can be turned into a script.  Though, you will likely notice the compilation
overhead much moreso with C++ than C99.  That said, for repeated invocation an
output binary can be saved with the `-x` option should repeated recompilation be
prohibitively expensive.

C11
---

C11 can be used via a symlink named [c11sh](c11sh) with control files like
`c11shrc`.

The idea for `c99sh` came from [21st Century
C](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025108.do)'s section "Compiling C
Programs via Here Document" ([available
online](http://cdn.oreilly.com/oreilly/booksamplers/9781449327149_sampler.pdf))
by [Ben Klemens](http://ben.klemens.org/). Additionally, I wrote it somewhat in
reaction to browsing the C++-ish work by
[elsamuko/cppsh](https://github.com/elsamuko/cppsh).

The dual shebang/compiled approach was suggested by
[mcandre](http://github.com/mcandre) and
[jtsagata](http://github.com/jtsagata).  Thank you both for pushing on the
idea, as I did not think it could be done in three clean lines.
